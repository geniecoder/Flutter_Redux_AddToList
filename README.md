# flutter_redux_addtolist

Currently I am working on the project, please follow me to get updated.

Hi, I have written this simple Flutter app in redux architecture. In this app user can add item in the list by writing some text. Data will be saved locally by using Shared Preference (Share Prefrence is the simplest way to save data locally).
